# Graph Search Algorithms
This repository contains a simple implementation of the A* and Greedy search algorithms for finding the shortest path from a starting node to Bucharest in a graph. The implementation is written in C++ and uses the following data structures and algorithms:

`std::unordered_map `: an associative container that stores key-value pairs with unique keys
`std::vector`: a container that stores a sequence of elements
`std::priority_queue`: a container adapter that provides constant-time access to the largest or smallest element
`std::set`: an associative container that stores unique elements in a sorted order
### Installation
To use this implementation, you must have a C++ compiler installed on your machine, such as GCC or Clang. You can then clone this repository and compile the main.cpp file using the following command:

```
$ g++ main.cpp -o main
```
### Usage
To run the program, execute the following command:
```
$ ./main
```
The program will output the shortest path from a starting node to Bucharest using the A* and Greedy search algorithms. After executing the program, you will be prompted to choose the starting node from where the search for Bucharest should begin.
